# Design Patter in CSharp

This project is based on the [article](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern): https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern

As this article is written in JAVA, I have only converted to C# and also added with some C# 6;

## About the Patterns

The patters are treated isolated, so sometimes you will find a pattern that could be implemented with another one. So you can mix then to improve your development.

### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, fixing, imrpoving or adding new patterns, help yourself and fork it ;)

## Built With

This code is written on VS Community, but I'll try to make a version to run on VS Code as well ;) (TODO)
